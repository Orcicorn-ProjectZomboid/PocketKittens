title=Pocket Kittens
description=Wake up, scavage for food, kill your neighbors, go to bed, cry.  Wake up, scavage for food, kill your family, go to bed, cry. Wake up... day after day after day. It's mundane, it's depressing and it's every so lonely until one day.... a little furball shows up on your door. He's hungry, he's desperate, he NEEDS YOU.  Life has a purpose, Mr Mittens needs you, he needs your food, your love and your attention.  Things don't seem quite as gloomy anymore.

description=Pocket Kittens adds several different breeds of kitties for you to trap and give a "furever home" to.  They roam mostly in cities and trailer parks but can sometimes be found in the forest.  Set up traps with the appropriate bait and wait.  Eventually you'll find yourself a new friend. Once you do, take them home for cuddles or maybe put some effort into making a safe pocket for them to join you on your travels.
